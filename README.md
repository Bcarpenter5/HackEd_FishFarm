# HackEd_FishFarm
Our Repo for 2023 hackEd Hackathon

Inspiration
Our inspiration stems from the urgent need for sustainable agriculture.

What it does
Our aquaponics farm integrates fish and plant farming. Fish waste nourishes plants, while plants filter and purify water for fish. This closed-loop system yields organic produce and fish, promoting sustainable agriculture.

How we built it
We built circuits to interface between various sensors and a main micro-controller. We then created a UI to be displayed on a local LCD. Then we sent data from the sensors to a second micro through serial communication which then sent information to a webpage which can interact with the farm. The housing for the circuits was all custom 3D printed.

Challenges we ran into
Building the signal conditioning circuits. Getting UART to work between the two micros. Some 3D prints not coming out right. Learning new technologies on the fly.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
How well we were able to divide and conquer the project. Getting each of our individual pieces of the project to work together.

What we learned
We learned a lot about working in a team environment, and each of us had to learn new technologies to make the project work.

What's next for Aquaponics Farm
Scaling our design up to a larger more practical model.
